# Introduction

Indian football has experienced a long and eventful journey marked by moments of glory, struggles, and steady development. This project focuses on analyzing the performance of the Indian national football team over the years by studying match outcomes—wins, draws, and losses—against various rival nations. By reviewing historical match records, we aim to uncover patterns and shifts in performance across different decades.

The analysis sheds light on the evolution of the team, identifying years of strong performance and periods of decline. It also highlights how the team has progressed in international competitions and where setbacks have occurred. This study offers valuable insights into the team’s consistency, competitive edge, and overall growth. Through this exploration, we aim to better understand the dynamics of Indian football and reflect on how the team’s journey mirrors broader changes in sports development and management in the country.

# Project Overview

This project analyzes the performance of the Indian national football team from 1938 to 2024 using Python and PostgreSQL. It explores wins, losses, draws, and goal statistics to uncover performance trends, improvements, and setbacks. Through data-driven insights, the project highlights India’s journey, regional dominance, and evolving competitiveness in international football, especially in **AFC-level** and **SAFF Championship** matches.

# Tools 

In this project, **PostgreSQL** was used to store and manage the dataset efficiently. **Python**, along with Jupyter Notebook, was used for exploratory data analysis. Libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn helped in data manipulation and visualization, enabling clear insights into the Indian football team's performance trends, match outcomes, and goal statistics across different years.

# Analysis 

**Analysis of Indian Football Team Performance (1938–2024)**

The Indian national football team played its first recorded international match in **1938**. Since then, it has participated in **533** AFC-level matches, securing **197** wins, **111** draws, and **225** losses, showcasing a long and evolving journey in international football.

The win percentage stands at 36%, with noticeable improvement after the year **2000**. This indicates steady growth in performance and competitiveness in regional and continental competitions.

The 1950s and early 1960s are widely regarded as the Golden Era of Indian football. During this period, under the legendary coach Syed Abdul Rahim, the team achieved major success, including top finishes in Asian Games and Olympics.

However, the **1980s** marked a low point, with a sharp increase in defeats. The goal-conceded rate peaked during this time, indicating poor defensive strategies and lack of international competitiveness.

After 2000, there is a positive trend in both wins and goal-scoring ability. The number of goals scored per match began rising, reflecting stronger attacking tactics and improved player performance.

Despite improvements in attack, defensive weaknesses persisted, especially during some years post-2000, as shown by spikes in goals conceded.

India showed dominance in South Asian football, recording the most victories against Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and Maldives, particularly in SAFF Championships. The team scored the highest number of goals (51) against Sri Lanka.

The last 10 years (2014–2024) saw fluctuating performance. Notably, 2017 and 2023 were standout years with major wins, while 2024 recorded no victories, marking a concerning drop in form.

India's biggest win was a 7-0 victory against Sri Lanka in **1963**, and the worst defeat came in **1955** with a 1-11 loss to the Soviet Union, during which Indian players reportedly played without boots. This loss became a catalyst for structural changes in Indian football.

Over time, coaching improvements, youth development, and increased international exposure have contributed to gradual progress.

However, the team still faces challenges in maintaining consistency, especially at the Asian and global levels.

# Conclusion

This project highlights the Indian football team’s journey from early struggles to regional dominance. Through data analysis, we uncovered performance trends, golden eras, setbacks, and growth over decades. The insights reflect improved competitiveness and consistency in recent years. With continued development, Indian football holds promise for greater achievements on the continental and global stage in the future.
