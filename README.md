# Introduction

Indian football has experienced a long and eventful journey marked by moments of glory, struggles, and steady development. This project focuses on analyzing the performance of the Indian national football team over the years by studying match outcomes—wins, draws, and losses—against various rival nations. By reviewing historical match records, we aim to uncover patterns and shifts in performance across different decades.

The analysis sheds light on the evolution of the team, identifying years of strong performance and periods of decline. It also highlights how the team has progressed in international competitions and where setbacks have occurred. This study offers valuable insights into the team’s consistency, competitive edge, and overall growth. Through this exploration, we aim to better understand the dynamics of Indian football and reflect on how the team’s journey mirrors broader changes in sports development and management in the country.
